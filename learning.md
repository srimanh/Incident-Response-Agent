## Hour 1 — API Contract & Agent Flow Design

- Designed a structured API contract for incident analysis
- Defined multi-stage agent workflow for secure AI reasoning
- Learned the importance of locking JSON schemas early
- Focused on explainability and safety-first design

## Hour 2 — Incident Classification Engine

- Implemented real-time incident classification using LLM (OpenRouter/OpenAI)
- Designed a strict system prompt to force structured JSON output
- Implemented safety-first logic: confidence threshold (0.6) to prevent speculation
- Learned how to handle LLM response parsing and category mapping in Spring Boot
